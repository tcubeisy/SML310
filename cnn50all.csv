How a convicted terrorist became a US citizen,,"
      A one-time Islamic jihadist who spent years in an Israeli prison for attempting to bomb a bus was granted US citizenship and allowed to remain in the country for nearly a decade as federal authorities investigated his background, CNN has learned. 
  
      The case of convicted terrorist-turned-US-citizen Vallmoe Shqaire raises questions not only about how Shqaire slipped past the enhanced vetting process implemented after 9/11, but also about why US law enforcement did not act more swiftly once his deception was discovered.
  
      Federal authorities have been aware since at least 2010 that Shqaire was arrested on a bombing-related charge in Israel and served time in prison. They’ve had fingerprint evidence conclusively linking him to the terrorist act, committed under the name Mahmad hadr Mahmad Shakir, since early 2016, according to federal court records.

"Kushner previews 'in-depth operational document' for Middle East peace, says Trump 'will be proud'",,"
      Jared Kushner did not unveil the administration’s plan for Middle East peace during a discussion Thursday evening titled “Inside the Trump Administration’s Middle East Peace Effort: A Conversation With Jared Kushner.”
  
      He did, however, offer vague details on what the plan will entail during the 45-minute conversation at the Washington Institute, calling it an “in-depth operational document” that is “realistic, executable… and will lead to both sides being much better off.”
  
      “We’ve put together, I would say, more of an in-depth operational document that shows what we think is possible, how people can live together, how security can work, how interaction can work, and really, how you try to form the outline of what a brighter future can be,” President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser said Thursday, detailing his team’s assessment phase and adding that they have also created a “business plan” outlining their economic vision for the region.

Israeli minister calls for closure of embassy in Dublin after settlements vote,,"
      Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman has called for the “immediate” closure of his country’s embassy in Dublin after the upper house of the Irish parliament voted to ban the import of goods produced in Israeli settlements.  
  
      The comments came after Israel summoned Ireland’s ambassador in Tel Aviv shortly after the vote at the Irish senate, known as the Seanad, on Wednesday. 
  
      “There is no point in summoning the Ambassador of Ireland for a ‘reprimand,’” Lieberman wrote in a tweet on Thursday. “Israel needs to immediately close the embassy in Ireland. We don’t turn the other cheek to those who boycott us,”

'We will still resist': West Bank village digs in as demolition looms,,"
      A hair-raising dash across a busy highway is one of two ways of reaching the West Bank Bedouin community of Khan al-Ahmar. The other is to navigate a rugged and barely passable dirt track.
  
      Located between two Israeli settlements, the ramshackle village is home to more than 150 Palestinians Bedouins who raise sheep and goats, but Israel views this community as illegal. A combination of corrugated iron, tarpaulins, shipping pallets and other refuse comprise most homes in this impoverished community that lacks running water and connection to the electrical grid.
  
      Khan al-Ahmar has been at the center of a legal battle stretching back almost a decade. Parts of the West Bank are run by the Palestinian Authority, but more than half of it remains under full Israeli control, including the land on which Khan al-Ahmar stands.

      Early Sunday morning, the two were taken from the HaSharon prison in central Israel to a West Bank border crossing, then on to their village of Nabi Saleh and released. 
  
      The young activist received a hero’s welcome upon returning home. Video from Nabi Saleh showed dozens of her supporters waved Palestinian flags and cheered for Tamimi, who turned 17 in prison. As she walked through the crowd, many lined up to hug the teenager.

      Rather than design and build a new embassy compound, which officials say could take several years and cost as much as a billion dollars, the State Department has decided to retrofit an existing US consular facility in the West Jerusalem neighborhood of Arnona, which sits near the Green Line, the de facto border of Israel before the 1967 war.

The council also demanded that Israel revoke a decision to annex East Jerusalem and cease settlement activity in the West Bank.

A wall runs through it: New road divides Israelis and Palestinians,,"
      The newest road in the West Bank is sparking controversy. Designed to ease traffic between Jerusalem and nearby settlements, it looks and feels like any other road. Israeli officials call it Route 4370, but its detractors have another name for it: “apartheid road.”
  
      The road, which runs north-south, is actually two parallel roads separated by an 8-meter (approximately 26 feet) concrete wall topped with metal fencing. The western half is designed for Palestinians, though it can be used by anyone, and it bypasses Jerusalem; the eastern half is for Israelis, and anyone else with a legal permit to enter Jerusalem. 
  
      Israeli officials say the western road will alleviate Palestinian congestion in the area by connecting traffic from north of Jerusalem towards east and south, without requiring drivers to pass through checkpoints around Jerusalem.

Why Israel's Arab parties made a historic move against Netanyahu,,"
      Ayman Odeh said it was possibly the most difficult decision of his life. Israel’s leading Arab politician was referring to Sunday’s announcement that the Joint List, an alliance of Arab parties that he heads, would recommend Benny Gantz as the next Israeli Prime Minister.
  
      It is only the second time in Israel’s history that Arab parties have given such a recommendation after an election – normally they do not signal a preference. The only other time they did so was in 1992, when they offered backing for Yitzhak Rabin, who had promised to pursue peace with the Palestinians if elected.
  
      The Arab parties stayed out of the coalition Rabin formed, but offered their support in key votes in Parliament. This time, too, the Joint List said its support for Gantz would not extend to joining him in government. Instead, it would back Gantz to stop the country’s longest-serving Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, from retaking office. Writing in the "
